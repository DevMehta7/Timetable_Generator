# Timetable_Generator
Automatic Timetable Generator

INTRO: Timetable Generator is basically our diploma final year project based on python's Django framework. In our college, the timetable was use to build manually so we decide to attempt that task

WORKING: It takes neccessary info from admin like (faculty details, classroom details, batches and division,semester and their subjects....). Then after lot of operations it ends up directly to timetable exciting.

RANDOM POINTS: Its a great task to design its database and that working perfect although it was my task. It isn't completely functional as inedequete team,guidance and knowledge. As it is more challenging project for beginners like us we came to know alot.
